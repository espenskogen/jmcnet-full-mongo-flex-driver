<wiki:toc max_depth="1" />

= Introduction =

This project aims to provide to the community a full and reliable Flex Driver for [http://www.mongodb.org/ MongoDB]. Some others initiatives exists, but I found it unusable in a professional environment. 


= Details =

Main features are :
  # Connexion pooling,
  # Safe mode enabling,
  # Direct CRUD object manipulation,
  # Full Aggregation support (group, MapReduce, ...),
  # BSON encoder and decoder,
  # ObjectID helper.
