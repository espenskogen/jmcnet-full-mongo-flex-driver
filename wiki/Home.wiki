This project aims to provide to the community a full and reliable Flex Driver for [http://www.mongodb.org/ MongoDB]. Some others initiatives exists, but I found it unusable in a professional environment.

Main features are :
  # Connexion pooling,
  # Safe mode enabling,
  # Direct CRUD object manipulation,
  # Full Aggregation support (group, MapReduce, ...),
  # BSON encoder and decoder,
  # ObjectID helper.
